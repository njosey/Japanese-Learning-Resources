# Japanese Learning Resources
This repository serves the purpose of sharing reources that i use to learn Japanese so all of my personal recomendations can be in one place and not scattered on the internet in replies to people

You do not have to follow the resources in this list in any particular order, it is best to tailor your learning experience to yourself and use these resources in any order. These are only suggestions so you dont have to use them if you dont want to but they are the best resources i have found in my Japanese Learning journey that have worked for me so i wanted to share them in the hopes that others can find good guides to teach them Japanese without browsing the internet to try and find resources on their own

## General:

### Jumping off point / Starting Point
Below are some resources which i believe are a good starting point to get into japanese as an absolute beginner

[Tofugu's Hiragana Page](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana/)  
[Tofugu's Katakana Page](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-katakana/)

I now recomend starting genki and and following its structure after learning hiragana and katakana and looking at the morg.systems resource as a general guide on what to look for when learning Japanese

### Japanese Grammer Guides

I'd know recomend learning grammer from genki over sakubi because i personally find it easier to follow genki over sakubi

## Speaking & Listening:

### Mirroring resources

What is mirroring ?: mirroring in language learning is basically listening to a native speaker of the language you are learning and trying to replicate them as best as possible
